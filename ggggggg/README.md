# ggggggg


We have discovered a new species of aliens! They look like this and are trying to communicate with us using the /r/ggggg subreddit! As you might have been able
to tell, though, it is awfully hard to understand what they're saying since their super-advanced alphabet only makes use of two letters: "g" and "G".
Fortunately, their numbers, spacing and punctuation are the same.
We are going to write a program to translate to and from our alphabet to theirs, so we can be enlightened by their intelligence.
Feel free to code either the encoding program, the decoding program, or both.
Also, please do not actually harass the residents of /r/ggggg.


First, we need to be able to understand what the Ggggg aliens are saying. Fortunately, they are cooperative in this matter, and they helpfully include a "key"
to translate between their g-based letters and our Latin letters. Your decoder program needs to read this key from the first line of the input, then use it to
translate the rest of the input.
